Basic writing and formatting syntax

Headings

To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks.
To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link

Relative links

You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

*GitHub*

will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or  works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../.

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

Nested Lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.
