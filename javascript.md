|the mission                  | the details|
|DEFINE THE GOAL              |First, you need to define the task you want to achieve       |
|DESIGN THE SCRIPT            | To design a script you split the goal This can be represented using a flowchart.|
|CODE EACH STEP               | Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands|



**An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value.**
 Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1 EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign).
var color = 'beige';
2 EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value. For example: var area = 3 * 2;


*OPERATORS*:
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
